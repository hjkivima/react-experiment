# An Economics Experiment Using React

This folder includes React components to build a survey using TypeScript and Google Firebase.

To build a survey, do the following:

- Initiate a Firebase project and fill out the values in firebase.ts / firebaseConfig

- Add new components to the pages variables in App.tsx. They will automatically appear in the navigation sidebar

- Before launching this production, set show={false} for Navigation in App.tsx
