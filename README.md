# An Economics Experiment Using React

This folder includes React components to build a survey using TypeScript and Google Firebase.

To build a survey, do the following:

- Initiate a Firebase project and fill out the values in firebase.ts / firebaseConfig

- Add new components to the `pages` variable in `App.tsx`. These will automatically appear in the navigation sidebar

- Before launching the survey, set `show={false}` for Navigation in `App.tsx`
